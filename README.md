Just another stupid who only know loop try to do machine learning!

## Linear Regression
This is very easy technique and easy to implement in code. You only need to understand some basic principles, such as: population and sample, range, invariants, correlations and slopes.
The challenge is how we find best fitting line that squared all points in our two dimensional data model. One known approach to find best fitting line is by calculate slope using partial data. For example, if the trend likely increase at current time, than we consider to calculate only most recent data.
