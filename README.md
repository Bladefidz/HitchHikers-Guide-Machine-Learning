# HitchHikers-Guide-Machine-Learning
This is extended version of [Conor Dewey](https://github.com/conordewey3)'s repository.
At first i looked into this, it seems too much simplification.
I know how to code that and that, but since i have no solid basis in mathematic, especially statistic and probability, all the codes does not make any sense to me.
So, i decided to looking deeper into statistical world and practice all i just knew into a computer code. Since i am programmer and i knew little bit about computational model, then i will tried to build some programming interfaces for each 'learning model' and applied them to do study cases.
Since i am good at reading, here some references that i used to understand fundamental of 'machine learning':

* [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher M. Bishop](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55881.Pattern_Recognition_and_Machine_Learning)
